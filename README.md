# Launchpad
### A ready-to-go express server for faster backend production.


## <br>Quick launch:
Clone repo and push to your own: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cpalmer-atx/launchpad.git
```

```
$ cd launchpad
```

```
$ git remote remove origin
```

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>.git
```

```
$ git branch -M main
```

```
$ git push -u origin main
```

<br>Install packages:

```
$ npm i
```

<br>Start server:

```
$ npm run server
```

## <br>Building a React client to go with it?

Install a client folder with a default React App already in it:

```
$ npx create-react-app client
```

In root package.json, add the following:

```
"scripts": {
  "client": "npm start --prefix client",
  "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\"npm run client\""
}
```

## All Set!

<br>Spin up both servers:
```
$ npm run dev
```

## What just happened?
<br>
First, a React application was initialized with 'create-react-app' in a new 'client' folder.  This app runs out of the box on port 3000 when executed on the client level.  The backend Express server runs on port 5000.  Concurrently provides a more robust way to run multiple commands at once.  This is carried out with the 'dev' and 'client' addition to the root package.json.  Notice that 'client' uses the React script while '--prefix client' instructs the command to be carried out in the client folder.  Finally, 'dev' runs the existing 'server' and new 'client' scripts together.
